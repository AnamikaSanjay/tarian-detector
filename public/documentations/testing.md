# Current Support

Project currently supports
    ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS >= 5.8.0 and <= 6.12.0

we have randomly tested the code on kernel version >=5.0.0. Our project is working without any issues on kernel versions >= 5.8.0.

# Supporting evidence
Going forward! we are gonna test our code on more kernel versions and will try to add more detailed output information.

kernel version - 5.8.0

# How did we tested our project?
- Once the code was ready. we built our project in the local environment and exported the generated executable to the virtual machine.
- We booted the virtual machine with desired kernel version and simply ran the executable over the machine.
